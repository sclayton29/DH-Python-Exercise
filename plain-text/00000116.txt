l. “ In December it was known that transit camps for prisoners of war captured
by the Communists in Korea had been established in Komsomolsk on the Amur,
Magadan on Bogaeva Bay in the Sea of Okhotsk, Chita and Irkutsk. Through those
transit camps were passing not only Korean P.O.W.s but also American P.O.W.s.

2‘ “ Since July 1951, according to new information, several transports of
Korean P.O.W.s have passed through the ports of Bukhta (near Vladivostok),
Okhotsk and Magadan. Each ship has contained 1,000 or more prisoners. Between
the end of November 1951 and April 1952, transports of P.O.W.s were sent by rail
from the Poset railway junction on the Chinese—Soviet frontier. Some were
directed to Chita in Eastern Siberia and some to Molotov, European Soviet
Russia, East of Ural Mountains.

3. “ Those P.O.W.s who arrived by ship in the ports of Bukhta, Okhotsk and
Magadan were then transported by train, or by trucks or by motor driven barges,
to Vaikaren on the Chukotsk Sea, to Ust Maisk on the river Aldan and to Yakutsk
on the river Lena.

4. “ P.O.W.s shipped to Vaikaren were sent to a network of camps in the Nizhni
Kolymsk region on the East Siberian Sea, to be employed building roads, electric
power plants and airfields. Their number varies considerably due to high
mortality and to transfer to other camps on the Chukotski Peninsula. All these
camps are under supervision of MVD and are entirely isolated. There were about
12,000 Korean P.0‘W.s in April 1952 in the Nizhno Kolymsk camp network. The
camps were under the charge of (fnu) sorotchuk, a major of MVD and (fnu) Chimbo,
a civilian Party functionary, probably an employee of MGB. Chimbo was in charge
of education and political indoctrination.
