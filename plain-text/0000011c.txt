and Adalbert Skala - have some to the Enbaeey recently and proffered information
concerning Americans whom they claim to have seen or met in various Soviet labor

oampl .

A. Walter Stimk (see Enbdes A91, November 28, 1955) reported that in addition to
Henry Malinauskaa, he s anally knew the following Americans:

Colonel Rudolf CZERNY. Stipsk last saw Czerny in Vorkuta on May 2b,, 1955.
He said that Czemy, unlike those prisoners awaiting repatriation who had
been allowed to let their hair gmw, still had his head shaven. He was in
bad health and not quite up to par mentally. He told stipek that he had _
been arrested in Western Germany in 1%? or 191.8. When Embassy officers 5/
expressed surprise that Czerny was arrested in Western Germany, Stipek
agreed that it was odd but said that was what Czerny had told him. Czerny '
said that he had been kept almost entirely in solitary confinement at Butyr-j
skaya prison in Moscow before he was sent to Vorkuta. He was not allowed to
write or receive letters and thinks that American authorities do not know he
is detained by the Soviets. When Stipek left Vorkuta Czerny's address was
Perysilka (a transit camp), Vorknta P.O. Box 175/ 58. Stipek stated that at
the time of his departure Vorkuta was no longer supposed to be a can: for
foreigners and that it is possible that Czemy may have been transferred
elsewhere. ‘

FOLLDBTON. An American Communist who went to the USSR in 1932. He was
first employed as a worker in a steel combine at Mamitogorsk. From 191.];
to l9h8, he worked as an Exglish-language broadcaster for Radio Moscow.
Stipek thinks that Fomngton is probably not the man's correct name, but
one assumed for his radio Job. Fomngton is mrried to a Russian and has a
Russian family. He told Stipek that he went to the Dnsricsn Enbassy in M
cow in 191.8 and applied, unsuccessmlly, for an Amorican passport. He is
now completely disillusioned with Communism and the Soviet Union and, des-
pite his Russian family, only wants to get out and return to the United
States. Stipek‘did not know the location of Fomngton's home in the Unit
