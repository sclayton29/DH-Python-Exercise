Dr. Samuel Shabat, a fonner FrenCh citizen who was incarce-
rated in various Soviet prison camps from June lth until February
1957, has reported to an Embassy officer that there was an American
Air Force officer held in a Soviet prison camp in l95l. Shabat
had not seen the American and was not held in the same camp but

had heard from other prisoners of the former's existence. Accord—
ing to Shabat, the American was held in Camp No. ll of the Norilsk
'prison complex near Dudinka in the northern part of the Krasnoyarski
Krai. He allegedly was an American Air Force officer attached to
the United States Military Aid Group training Turkish pilots in
Turkey. He had made a forced landing some time in 1951 just inside
the Soviet border somewhere in the area of Erevan. He had been
sentenced to 25 years in prison as an espionage agent and, as of
September 1953, had been held for sometime at Camp No. ll. Shabat
was unable to provide the name of the American involved and doubts

that he ever heard it.

The Embassy has no way of judging the veracity of the story
Shabat tells nor, for that matter, has he. The report is brought
to the attention of the Department, however, in the hope that it-

may conceivably be of some value.
For the Ambassador:
