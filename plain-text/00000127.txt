I telephoned Miss Virginie James, EE, this morning to discover

whether there was anyyaction the Department could usefulli take regarding
the four American individuals mentioned in Despatch No.2

from Strasbourg, who allegedly are being held in Soviet prisons. We -
agreed that since three or the men mentioned are described as American

soldiers and since the Department of the Amy and office of the Secretary

of Defense each had received four copies of this Despateh, it might be
expected that their own service would take some steps in the interests
of their personnel. I told her that while our interest in the military

personnel might take the form of consulting with the Ilenartnent of the '

Army, our primary: nterest probably should be in the civilian described
as Jack Watson ’ Ithe Desoatch. We both agreed that since the Consulste's
communication FMHIB info: mation as of very dubious character,

it was difficult to k what type of action the Department could
appropriately take. I suggested that Miss James seek to learn whether
a despatch had been received on the subject from Barcelona, where the
mother of the reporting refugee presumably lives, end which had been
marked down to receive a copy of the referenced Despatch. Miss James
promised to let me know as soon as she could nlace her hands on the

Barcelona message.
