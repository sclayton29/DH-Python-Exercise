4. REPORT OF FINDINGS

On 15 November 1957, Juergen Schmidt, a German national and re-
patriated political prisoner, born 3 March 1928 in Berlin (UU9220), Ger-
many, presently residing at Benediktinerstrasse 12, Berlin-Frohnau (French
Sector), was interviewed concerning (Emu) Schwartz, an alleged American
in Soviet custody, and stated substantially as follows:

Schmidt served in the VOPO (Volkspolizei - People's Police) from
1948 to November 1949, when he fled to West Berlin. Ihile processing as
a refugee, Schmidt was sent by British officials to his residence in Pots-
dam (UUSBOY). GDR (German Democratic Republic) in order to get some offi-
cial documents. Ihile he was in Potsdam, Schmidt was arrested by Soviet r
security police. Schmidt was tried and sentenced to 25 years in a Soviet\
corrective labor camp. From October 1950 to November 1955, Schmidt
served his sentence in labor camps in Vorkuta (nca) and Gorki (nca), USSR.
Schmidt and other German prisoners were repatriated in November 1955, and
Schmidt returned to Nauen (UU5650), GDR,where he has relatives. From
January 1956 to November 1957, Schmidt was employed in Nauen and Elstal
(nca), GDR, as a movie—projectionist. Schmidt's supervisor tried to force
Schmidt to join the Communist Party, but Schmidt refused and fled to West

Berlin.

  

 

 

In 1951,xwhile Schmidt was in Camp 6 in Yorkuta, he was intro-
duced to an American officer, Major (Fun) Schwarts,;by Hans Niedermeir, ,,
.a German national, formerly a major in a German armored division. Schmidtc'
believes that Schwartz' first name is Robert. Schwartz spoke only English}
and Russian at the time, and Schmidt spoke only German. Therefore, most
of the information received from Schwartz was told to Schmidt or inter—
preted for him by Niedermeir. Schmidt describes Schwartz as 51 to 56%
years old, 5'10" to 6' tall, 165 to 175 pounds, dark hair, dark comple—
xion, poor,prctruding teeth with one (1) upper front tooth missing.

Schwartz habitually smoked a pipe. Schmidt played chess and cards with g g
Schwartz. Schwartz worked in the building housing the machinery which g
operated the coal mine, which led Schmidt to believe that Schwartz had w
some special mechanical training or ability. 5 8

Prior to his capture and imprisonment, Schwartz had been a major¥& g
in the us Army, stationed in Frankfurt (“7752). GFR (German Federal Re- 8 ':
.publie), and a member of the GIG (counter Intelligence Corps). Schwartz g g
was kidnapped by Soviet security police in 1949 in Kassel‘(xB5585), GER, : 8
while Schwartz and another employee or member of the CIC, name unknown, 8 S
